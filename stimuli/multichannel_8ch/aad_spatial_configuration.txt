AAD Multichannel Spatial Configuration
=====================================

Channels: 8
Creation Date: 19-Oct-2025 02:04:21

3D Speaker Configuration:
1. FL: Azimuth=30°, Elevation=20°
2. FR: Azimuth=-30°, Elevation=20°
3. C: Azimuth=0°, Elevation=0°
4. LFE: Azimuth=0°, Elevation=0°
5. SL: Azimuth=110°, Elevation=15°
6. SR: Azimuth=-110°, Elevation=15°
7. BL: Azimuth=150°, Elevation=25°
8. BR: Azimuth=-150°, Elevation=25°

Primary AAD Positions: FL(30°/20°) FR(-30°/20°) SL(110°/15°) SR(-110°/15°) BL(150°/25°) BR(-150°/25°) 

3D Competitive Scenario Design:
- Track 1 and Track 2 placed at different 3D spatial positions
- Elevation-dependent HRTF simulation for height perception
- 3D-aware cross-talk to adjacent speakers (12% base level)
- Elevation-dependent decorrelation (0-6ms delays)
- Azimuth and elevation cues for enhanced spatial attention
- Maintains competitive paradigm for 3D AAD research

Elevation Benefits for AAD:
- Enhanced spatial separation between competing sources
- Additional neural cues for attention decoding
- More realistic 3D listening environment
- Potential for improved algorithm performance
