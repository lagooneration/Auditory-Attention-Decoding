## 📈 Technical Insights

### Spatial Configuration
- **8-channel setup**: 3D speaker array with elevation (20°-25°)
- **HRTF simulation**: Head-related transfer function modeling  
- **Elevation-dependent processing**: Enhanced spatial separation

### Processing Pipeline
- **Gammatone filterbank**: 15 frequency bands (150-4000 Hz)
- **Power-law envelopes**: α = 0.6 for neural relevance
- **Cross-validation**: Leave-one-trial-out design
- **Sample size**: N = 16 subjects, ~32-40 min of data per subject

## ⚠️ Methodological Notes

### Preprocessing Warning
```
Warning: Gammatone filters not available. Using basic envelope extraction.
```
**Impact**: 8-channel preprocessing used simplified envelope extraction rather than full gammatone decomposition. Despite this limitation, results show strong spatial enhancement effects.

### Statistical Power
- **Correlation**: Extremely high power (p < 0.001)
- **TRF**: Adequate sample size for detecting medium effects
- **CCA**: Sufficient power for observed large negative effect

## 🔮 Future Directions

1. **Optimize 8-channel CCA**: Investigate regularization strategies for multichannel CCA
2. **Real-time implementation**: Test correlation algorithm in online scenarios  
3. **Expanded spatial configs**: 16+ channel arrays with full spherical coverage
4. **Clinical validation**: Test with hearing-impaired populations
